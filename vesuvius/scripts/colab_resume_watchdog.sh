#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Watches a detached colab_train.sh run for stalls (no new checkpoint within
# STALL_TIMEOUT) and automatically resumes it on a fresh session, patching in
# the local uncommitted/unpushed source files each time. Built live after a
# single ink_tutorial_s3.json full-training run needed 4 manual resumes due to
# recurring, undiagnosed `colab exec`/session-death reliability issues (see
# docs/colab.md "colab exec reliability"). Ground truth for "is it alive" is
# always a new checkpoint file landing on Drive, never the colab CLI's own
# session-status reporting, which was repeatedly observed to be wrong in both
# directions (false "session lost" while still training; true death not
# always reflected promptly).
#
# Usage:
#   REPO_URL=https://github.com/<you>/villa.git \
#   RCLONE_CONF_LOCAL=~/.config/rclone/rclone_vesuvius.conf \
#   CONFIG_LOCAL=../configs/ink_tutorial_s3.json \
#   RUN_NAME=ink_tutorial_s3 \
#   TARGET_ITERATIONS=20000 \
#   ./colab_resume_watchdog.sh
#
# Env vars (all optional except REPO_URL, RCLONE_CONF_LOCAL, CONFIG_LOCAL):
#   RUN_NAME            Basename used for out_dir/log naming   (default: derived from CONFIG_LOCAL)
#   TARGET_ITERATIONS   Stop once a checkpoint >= this exists  (default: read from config's num_iterations)
#   SAVE_EVERY          Expected checkpoint cadence, iters     (default: read from config's save_every)
#   STEP_SECONDS        Expected wall-seconds per iteration     (default: 1.3, used only to size the stall timeout)
#   STALL_GRACE         Extra seconds added on top of the expected per-checkpoint time (default: 900)
#   SESSION_PREFIX      Colab session name prefix               (default: RUN_NAME)
#   VESUVIUS_COLAB_GPU  GPU tier                                (default: l4)
#   POLL_SECONDS        How often to check Drive for a new checkpoint (default: 60)
#
# All colab_bootstrap.sh env vars are passed through as-is.
#
# Modified source files under src/vesuvius/ink_detection/ are pushed to
# Drive (gdrive:vesuvius/configs/<basename>.py) and pulled onto each
# fresh session — the same manual pattern used throughout this session,
# needed because these commits are not yet pushed to the remote the session
# clones from. Remove PATCH_FILES (or this whole block) once they are.
